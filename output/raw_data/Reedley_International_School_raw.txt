Basic Education Curriculum (BEC)
Mathematics
The MATHEMATICS course is based on Singaporean Mathematics Curriculum that improves the
mastery of mathematical concepts by starting with the concrete, then moving through
pictorial and finishing with the abstract.
English Language Arts
The GRADE SCHOOL ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS uses the standard that focuses on the following
strands—Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Conventions of Standard English
through formative exposure to a wide variety of literary and informational resources in a
rich and active learning environment. The Lower School 1 has begun transitioning to the
Common Core standards.
The GRADE SCHOOL ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS
course uses the Common Core standards and focuses on an integrated approach to learning and
using language effectively in all content areas and holistically builds proficiency in
speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
The JUNIOR HIGH
SCHOOL ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS course uses standards for English Language Arts and is
rooted in the four macro-skills of language—reading, writing, speaking and listening.
The SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH course uses a communicative
approach to help students prepare for college level English Courses. At the end of the
course, students are expected to have enhanced their facility of the English language and
proficiency in reading, writing and speaking.
Science
The SCIENCE course is based on the Singaporean Science Curriculum. It uses inquiry as its
framework, where the child is encouraged to be responsible for his own learning, the same
way scientists pursue their work. The students are exposed to everyday situations that will
mold them to be Reesians, in mind, who are critical thinkers and problem solvers. The course
challenges the students to solve current scientific issues and contribute to society.
The grade school Science course follows the standards set by the
Ministry of Education (MOE) of Singapore while the Junior High School Science Program
follows the Cambridge “O” Level Standards.
Social Studies
The SOCIAL STUDIES course follows the AERO Common Core Plus standards for Social Studies. It
is designed to address the standards of Time, Continuity & Change, Connections & Conflict,
Geography, Culture, Society & Identity, Government, Production, Distribution & Consumption,
and Science, Technology & Society.
Life Skills
The LIFE SKILLS course adopts the World Health Organization (WHO, 1997) definition of Life
Skills: “Life Skills are living skills or abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that
enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life.”
The course aims to equip students with skills needed to overcome issues they encounter in
their everyday life. The program centers on 3 areas: (1) spiral character education program,
(2) age-appropriate campaigns including Anti-Bullying, Career Exploration and Substance
abuse, and (3) Self-Management.
Physical Education
The PHYSICAL EDUCATION course uses the framework that ensures our students gain the proper
motor skills and sport specific skills needed to live a healthy and active lifestyle. It
uses the sport specific, skill building mastery framework to develop the whole child.
Arts and Music
The MUSIC AND ARTS course of Reedley aims to develop Reesians who are artistically and
musically creative and expressive of themselves through the education of Aesthetic Literacy
and Art/Music Production, to be global reflections of cultural identity and appreciation.
This will be achieved through Art and Music exposure to the canons and the understanding of
social, historical and cultural contexts of the arts in a nurturing environment that invokes
passion, promotes cultural tolerance and critical thinking.
Information Technology
The INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY course focuses on the procedures of using various software
applications as tools that help students do word processing procedures, make visual
presentation, data manipulation, photo, audio and video editing, and web developing to
attain high proficiency in Information Technology.
Filipino as a Foreign Language
The FILIPINO AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE curriculum is based on the Communication strand of Ohio
Strands for Educational Achievement and the Mother Tongue standards for bringing to a second
language. Focusing on communication, Filipino as a Foreign Language targets oral and written
communication skills (interpersonal), comprehension of live, written or recorded texts
(interpretive), and presentation of information and ideas on familiar topics to general
audiences or readers (presentational). The course aims to develop the Reesian at heart who
appreciates the different origins and cultures of people.

Frequently Asked Questions
How is Reedley an International School?
We have been here for 23 years as Reedley International School was founded in 1999. We are a private, non-sectarian, co-educational international school located in Pasig City, Metro Manila.
Reedley International School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC-USA) and is a regular member of the Council of International Schools (UK) and East Asia Regional Council of Schools (EARCOS). We are also certified by the Character Education Partnership (Philippines) as a Certified School of Character and maintain alliances with the Singapore Brain Development Center. Moreover, our faculty receives trainings here and abroad to broaden their skills and knowledge, ensuring they remain at the forefront of education practices.
Do you have expat or foreign families? What percentage of the student population do they make up?
As of School Year 2022 to 2023, foreign students make up 21.94% of the population.
Do you offer the IB Program?
No, we do not offer the IB program. Instead, we provide the Advanced Placement (AP) Program, which offers flexibility in subject selection, the potential for college credits, widespread recognition by colleges and universities, rigorous subject depth, and greater accessibility. The AP program allows students to tailor their curriculum based on their interests and goals, earn college credits, and develop strong analytical skills. We believe that the AP program better suits the diverse needs and aspirations of our students.
What is Reedley’s track record in university acceptance here and abroad?
100% of our students successfully gain admission to both local and foreign universities after graduation, with the exception of those who choose to pursue gap years, military service, or immediate employment opportunities.
What is your anti-bullying policy?
At Reedley International School, we have a zero-tolerance approach towards bullying. Our anti-bullying policy promotes a safe and inclusive environment through prevention and education initiatives. We encourage reporting of incidents, provide support and counseling to affected students, and take swift action to address bullying cases. Restorative measures are implemented to repair harm and promote empathy. We continuously monitor and review our policy to ensure its effectiveness in creating a nurturing and respectful school community.
Do you allow nannies to stay with students?
We provide a designated space for nannies to wait for students. In our Kindergarten Area, we have a designated area specifically for nannies to wait comfortably. Additionally, in the Reception area, we have a few chairs available for nannies to wait while their students are attending classes. We understand the importance of accommodating the needs of our students' caregivers and strive to provide a welcoming environment for all members of our school community.
How many nationalities have you catered to?
We have a diverse student population and have catered to students from over 25 nationalities, including the Philippines, USA, Canada, South Korea, China, Japan, India, among others.
What curriculum do you offer?
Reedley International School offers the best approaches of three curricula. While fulfilling DepEd academic regulations, our Mathematics and Science Programs adhere to Singaporean standards, and our Language Arts and Social Studies Programs adhere to American Standards.
Our academic curriculum has a set of routines, structures, and standards in place. We teach Life Skills, study habits, memory strategies, test-taking skills, and problem solving so that our students know how to think critically, decide soundly, and apply knowledge in practical and real-life situations.
Are you traditional or progressive?
We combine the best practices of progressive and traditional education to develop successful and excellent students who are kind and compassionate at heart, in mind, and in spirit. The Synergized Learning Approach at Reedley International School is an inclusive and learner-centered methodology that emphasizes active participation, critical thinking, and collaboration. It combines the best practices from various educational philosophies, including constructivism, inquiry-based learning, and project-based learning, to create a dynamic and engaging learning environment.
Do you accept non-English speaking students?
Reedley utilizes English as the language of instruction. Prospective students are required to undergo an entrance test conducted in English, which aids the school in assessing their proficiency in the language. If they are having difficulties, the school offers an English as Second Language program, which we will encourage to applicants as needed.
What is the age range for students?
We cater to students from Pre-K to Senior High 12, with an age range of 4-18 years old.
What are your academic offerings?
Reedley International School offers a comprehensive academic program that includes core subjects such as Math, Science, English, and Social Studies, as well as elective courses in the Arts, Music, Physical Education, and Foreign Languages.
For our Kinder program, the curriculum aims to prepare the young learner to enter Lower School by providing a strong foundation in five areas of development, namely in the Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, Psychomotor, Communication and Self-Help areas of development.
In Lower School, students are engaged in the Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) which comprises the following subjects: Mathematics, English Language Arts, Science, Social Studies, Life Skills, Physical Education, Arts and Music, Information Technology, and Filipino as a Foreign Language.
It is in Middle School that the concept of student leadership and community service is deepened along with academics. The Grade School Student Council organizes students in activities such as Teacher’s Day and socio-civic activities such as the outreach. Last year, students organized a thank you and farewell video for their teachers and also, raised funds to help another school in the province of Palawan whose classroom materials were destroyed by Typhoon Odette.
Other activities such as field trips, our anti-bullying campaigns, multicultural weeks, guest speakers are all part of a our purposive effort to make sure that when they step out of Grade School, they are ready to be high school students.
For the Reedley Junior High, we address difficulties in the fundamentals of academic subjects to achieve mastery and equip students with effective study skills and habits. The curriculum is rigorous and challenging as it adheres to the Common Core Standards in the U.S. in English Language Arts (Reading, Writing, Speaking, Language, Media and Technology), and Singapore standards for Math and Science.
In Senior High, we offer the various strands namely Accountancy, Business Management (ABM), General Academics (GAS), Humanities and Social Studies (HUMSS), Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), as well as other special courses to select students in High School. These are the Advanced Placement (AP), The Foreign Language Program, Filipino and Philippine History back subject, The CAPSTONE Program, Apprentice Week: SHS Work Immersion Program, and the Reedley School Community Action Program (RSCAP).
Do you have extra-curricular activities?
Yes! Extra-curricular activities depend on the school year. Students can join clubs such as the debate club, glee club, dance club, photography club, magazine club, among others after classes.
The school also has its own varsity team called Silverbacks, where athletic students can train under supervision.
Do you accept children with special needs?
We accept children with mild to moderate learning needs (Tier 1 and Tier 2) who are able to engage positively with teachers and classmates, and contribute to a classroom environment that supports learning for all. However, we are not equipped to support students whose diagnosed conditions—such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), or similar developmental and behavioral needs—require Tier 3-level interventions.
Admission is based on a careful review of each child’s profile and our capacity to provide an environment in which they can thrive.
What are CIAP and the High School Academic Support Program?
Reedley International School offers specialized learning support for students with learning challenges through its Center for Individualized Academic Program (CIAP) for Lower School 1 to Middle School 6 students. Likewise, the school provides extra guidance to help students with learning challenges.
Do you offer discounts?
Yes! There are discounts if two or more siblings are enrolled in the school.
Can you still accept mid-year enrollees?
The school's admissions office ideally considers a student's enrollment based on the availability of slots within the predetermined enrollment period. Contact our admissions officer for more details.
What sets Reedley apart from other international schools?
Our 22-year track record of consistent academic excellence, college passing, anti-bullying and kindness culture, personalized attention to both students and parents, and loving and committed teachers, leaders, and staff  set us apart from other educational institutions.
Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) has been an integral part of Reedley education for over 22 years and is offered through programs such as Life Skills, Life Coaching, Anti-Bullying, Career Counseling, College Admissions Test Review, and other initiatives that nurture well-rounded, compassionate, confident, and competent, and students.
