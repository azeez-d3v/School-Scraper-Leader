After considering their developmental readiness, students as young as two years old are able to develop their skills and interests in reading through multiple, different learning styles, and various learning modalities coupled with
Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI)
.

EMOTIONAL QUOTIENT
While intelligence is critical to optimizing learning, emotional and diligence quotients are similarly crucial. The ability to manage one’s emotions and persevere is the key to future success.
Programs like Values Convocation, Emotional Quotient/Achievers Core Training or EQ/ACT, and daily Story Time among others help SISC students develop their character and ability to collaborate harmoniously with people around them.
READING QUOTIENT
One of the distinctive features of Preschool is our strong Reading Program. Students as young as 2 years old are exposed to different reading materials that allow them to read at a very young age. Several activities support our reading programs such as Reader’s Theater, Lexile Book Reading, Story Telling with Parents, and many others. We believe that today’s readers are future leaders.
INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT
Brain development is at its peak from the time a child is born until 5 years of age. The intelligence of a child depends on how the environment stimulates it by giving children opportunities to grow and learn. The Executive Function (EF) in the brain allows multiple skills to be learned as they grow older. SISC has incorporated EF skills like the ability to focus manage tasks and ability to retain information which are important factors in brain development.
DILIGENCE QUOTIENT
Diligence, drive, doing, and determination to succeed are some of the things that are incorporated into the daily lessons in Preschool. These are evident and are shown in the Children’s portfolio which showcases the works, the achievements, and the outputs of the students that are given to parents to give them feedback and the progress of their children.
COMPUTER-TECHNOLOGY QUOTIENT
As early as Nursery students are exposed to computers in the classroom. Well-suited and age-appropriate applications are used to enhance the lessons taken in class. The KHAN ACADEMY KIDS and KHAN ACADEMY have helped in improving certain skills for mastery.

Group 1: Studies in Language and Literature
English A Language and Literature
This course aims at studying the complex and dynamic nature of language and exploring both its practical and aesthetic dimensions. It will explore the crucial role language plays in communication, reflecting experience and shaping the world, and the roles of individuals themselves as producers of language.
Korean A Literature
This course aims at exploring the various manifestations of literature as a particularly powerful mode of writing across cultures and throughout history. It aims at developing an understanding of factors that contribute to the production and reception of literature—the creativity of writers and readers, the nature of their interaction with their respective contexts and with literary tradition, the ways in which language can give rise to meaning and/or effect, and the performative and transformative potential of literary creation and response.
Group 2: Language Acquisition
English B
This course is designed for students with some previous experience of the target language. Students further develop their ability to communicate through the study of language, themes and texts. There are five prescribed themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing the planet.
Language ab initio
French ab initio
Mandarin ab initio
This course is designed for students with no previous experience in—or very little exposure to—the target language. It aims to develop the student’s receptive, productive and interactive skills while learning to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.
Group 3: Individuals and societies
Business Management
This course aims to develop students’ knowledge and understanding of business management theories, as well as their ability to apply a range of tools and techniques. Students learn to analyze, discuss and evaluate business activities at local, national, and international levels.
History
This is a world history course based on a comparative and multi-perspective approach to history. It involves the study of a variety of types of history, including political, economic, social, and cultural, and provides a balance of structure and flexibility.
Psychology

s.
Economics
Group 4: Sciences
Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Computer Science
This course helps students become aware of how scientists work and communicate with each other. While the scientific method may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical approach through experimental work that characterizes the sciences. Teachers provide students with opportunities to design investigations, collect data, develop manipulative skills, analyse results, collaborate with peers and evaluate and communicate their findings.
Group 5: Mathematics
Mathematics: analysis and approaches
This course recognizes the need for analytical expertise in a world where innovation is increasingly dependent on a deep understanding of mathematics. The focus is on developing important mathematical concepts in a comprehensible, coherent and rigorous way, achieved by a carefully balanced approach.
Mathematics: applications and interpretation
This course recognizes the increasing role that mathematics and technology play in a diverse range of fields in a data-rich world. As such, it emphasizes the meaning of mathematics in context by focusing on topics that are often used as applications or in mathematical modelling.
Group 6: The  Arts
Theatre
This course gives students the opportunity to actively engage in theatre as creators, designers, directors, and performers. It emphasizes working both individually and collaboratively as part of an ensemble.
Visual arts
This course encourages students to challenge their own creative and cultural expectations and boundaries. It develops students’ analytical skills in problem-solving and divergent thinking while working towards technical proficiency and confidence as art-makers. In addition to exploring and comparing visual arts from different perspectives and in different contexts, students are expected to engage in, experiment with, and critically reflect upon a wide range of contemporary practices and media.
