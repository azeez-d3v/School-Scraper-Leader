Welcome to the Early Learning Center (Nursery – Grade 2)
Welcome to Brent International School Manila Early Learning Center!
Our Brent School mission statement suggests that educational programs and processes involve students developing a high standard of academic excellence, a strong character founded on Christian values, and an international or global perspective. These high expectations for our students are achievable because Brent approaches school from a community perspective. Our Chapel theme for this 2024-2025 school year, “
Practice Gratitud
e”, provides us with additional motivation to strive towards becoming the individuals, citizens and leaders that makes Brent International School Manila unique.
We encourage you to read the
Lower School Academic Program
to know more of our curriculum from Nursery to Grade 5. Our academic program puts emphasis on the development of reading and writing skills in our students to equip them well in their core subjects, which also further enhances their listening and speaking skills. On the other hand, the special subjects provide students with a rich assortment of arts offerings, sports, values and spiritual growth.
You will also find here on our webpages our
Student-Parent Handbook
. As we grow as a school in the global scholastic environment we belong to, we look at best practices that will further enhance the learning experience of our students in the ELC and LS. These programs and practices are fundamentally what make Brent International School Manila the place to be.
We trust that our website provides you with most of the information you will need. Please check in regularly to see our weekly newsletter that comes out every Friday.

Welcome to Middle School (Grades 6 – 8)
Welcome to Brent International School Manila’s Middle School page! Brent school has some of the finest educators from around the world; they are the most qualified, well-prepared and enthusiastic group of educators you are likely to meet. Our goal is to not only aim for academic excellence, but to create responsible global citizens. Some of the values we strive to instil in our learners are critical thinking, technology literacy, and effective communication—we want them to explore their talents and interests well beyond the time spent without our walls.
Middle School is an important time in the development of young people. They begin to discover themselves as individuals, and start to seek more independence. We understand that it is during this time that students need extra support and role modeling as they interact with a wider group of friends, try on new identities, and start to form themselves into the types of adult they will one day become.
Whether you are already a member of the Brent Family or are considering enrolling, we invite you to browse our web site and contact us if you have any questions.

The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) authorized Brent International School Manila (IB School Code: 000432) to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) in October 1986.  The IBDP is a challenging and rigorous college preparatory curriculum designed for the last two years in high school.  We not only develop your children intellectually and academically, we develop them to be well-rounded individuals who will be of service both to their immediate environment and internationally.
Highly motivated students who consistently work at their best and under the mentorship of our highly qualified professionals turn out to be very successful in the IBDP.  With the recognition of the rigor of the IB diploma, students are most sought after by leading colleges and universities worldwide.   The IBDP is the best preparation that any student can have.  It is more of the process in education than merely numbers that represent students’ GPA.
I invite you to continue accessing the different pages and links to the IB to learn more about this challenging, rigorous college preparatory curricular framework.
Mabuhay!

English as a Second Language (ESL)
Goals and Objectives
Brent offers English as Second Language (ESL) to non-native speakers of English in grades 1-8 whose English Language competency is insufficient for them to be successful in our regular academic program.
The main objective of ESL is to prepare students for entry into the mainstream level of Brent’s regular academic program by fully developing English skills in the areas of reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
Required Levels of English Proficiency
Elementary School: Early Learning Center, Nursery-Grade 2, and Lower School, Grades 3-5
Students in Nursery through Grade 5 can be enrolled at Brent as a beginner in English (ESL Level 1). Nursery, Pre-Kindergarten, and Kindergarten students are not part of the specific ESL program due to their ages, the content covered, and teaching methods. Our philosophy is that all students are essentially learning English in these young ages even if it is the only language the child knows.
Students requiring support in learning English in grades 1-5 are ESL Level 1 (beginner), Level 2 (intermediate), or Level 3 (advanced). The level of the student is predicted in the admissions process, and then finalized once enrolled. The ESL program increases skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, while focusing on improving academic language in order to best support content learning in the mainstream classes. Students attend an ESL English class while mainstreamed students attend the regular English class with the Homeroom.
Middle School: Grades 6–8
Middle School uses four levels of ESL.
Level 1 applicants (beginners) are not accepted in Middle School.
Applicants must demonstrate at least Level 2 (low intermediate) skills to enter Grade 6 and 7 first semester.
Students entering Grade 7 second semester must be at least Level 3 (high intermediate).
Applicants to Grade 8 must demonstrate at least Level 3 skills for the first semester to be accepted, and Level 4 (advanced) if applying to second semester.
There are English proficiency requirements for Middle School grade levels since students are to be completely mainstreamed in the regular English program by Grade 9.
Upper School: Grades 9–12
Brent does not offer ESL in Upper School. Since students in Grades 9-12 are expected to be fluent in English, applicants are not accepted if their entrance test scores are in the ESL range.
Explanation of ESL Levels for Middle School ESL students
ESL 2
is a low intermediate level for students with basic communication skills but who are generally weak in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Students receive support for English, Social Studies and Science classes. Instead of a foreign language, ESL students take an additional English class. All other classes are with the regular mainstream class.
ESL 3
is a high intermediate level for students whose basic communication skills are good, but who still need assistance in strengthening areas such as grammar, vocabulary, punctuation, and reading comprehension. Students receive support for English, Social Studies and Science classes. Instead of a foreign language, ESL students take an additional English class. All other classes are with the regular mainstream class.
ESL 4
is for advanced ESL students. The emphasis is on polishing the student’s academic and presentation skills. Students receive support for English class. Instead of a foreign language, ESL students take an additional English class. All other classes are with the regular mainstream class.

Application Process
Application Process
IT Center
2024-11-29T11:32:44+08:00
Steps to Apply
Students can apply to either the current 2024-2025 school year (Quarter 3 begins January 6; Quarter 4 begins March 4), or to the 2025-2026 school year which begins early August.
Step One
Click on the red circle labeled “Click Here to Apply” to create an account and complete an online application per child. It is best completed using a computer with a Chrome browser and a strong internet connection. Enter an email address on the Father’s and / or Mother’s information page early in the process so that Admissions staff can reach out to offer support.
Step Two
After completing an application and uploading the needed documents on the Requirements page, email
admissionssecretary@brent.edu.ph
to share that you are ready to proceed with the next step.
You will be invited to pay the Application Fee and to schedule on-campus tests and interviews for your child/ren when the required documents have been received.
Step Three
The official decision from Brent’s Admissions Committee is shared after the appointments, usually within a few business days. If Brent offers an acceptance, the accompanying fee is paid within five business days. (Slot Reservation Fee, Wait Pool Fee, or Tuition depending on the timing and seat availability.)
Seat Availability
A family might inquire and be informed that seats are available, but on the day of test and interview appointments learn that the grade level is full. Seat availability fluctuates and can be difficult to predict.
Submitting documents, paying the Application Fee, and scheduling appointments does not reserve a seat for the applicant. (Please refer to the Guarantee Payment Letter if the applicant is a company dependent.)

Admissions Criteria
Admissions Criteria

2024-11-14T11:22:06+08:00
Admissions Criteria
Brent International School Manila is a college preparatory institution. Applicants interested in enrolling should apply with passing grades and a history of good behavior at school.
Applicants are accepted and retained on the basis of their ability to meet the academic, moral, and behavioral standards of Brent School. The Admissions Committee makes decisions in the best interest of the applicant, as well as in the best interest of the grade level and school.
The Admissions Committee evaluates the following when considering an applicant for admission:
Entrance test results.
Report cards from the current / recent school.
Confidential Evaluations from the current / recent school.
English language proficiency. ESL (English as a Second Language) support is available in grades 1-8.
Applicants requiring ESL support in grades 9-12 are not accepted.
Availability of learning support, if needed.
Interviews with the applicant. At least one parent is required to accompany the applicant.
The Admissions Committee has the right not to accept an applicant on the day of tests and interviews. Efforts are made to inform a family in advance if acceptance is not predicted, but sometimes it is the day of the scheduled appointments that makes it clear that acceptance is not possible.
The Admissions Committee has the right to determine the grade level and subjects deemed most appropriate for the student’s success.
English Support (ESL/ELL)
Beginners in English are accepted only into grades 5 and below.
For grades 6 and 7, at least intermediate English skills are required for acceptance.
By grade 8, students should have advanced English skills for acceptance.
Applicants must be fluent in English to be accepted to Grade 9 and above, which means excellent reading and writing skills.
Brent’s entrance tests will help determine the level of fluency of the applicant.
Students receive ESL/ELL instruction when their mainstreamed classmates meet for English class. ESL/ELL students are usually part of the mainstream class for all other subjects. Exceptions are made for beginners who might need to meet more often.
In Grades 6, 7, and 8 ESL/ELL students do not take a foreign language class, but instead take a second English class.
No Dormitory on Campus. Guardianships Need Approved.
Students are expected to live with at least one parent full-time while enrolled at Brent. Please inform Admissions when submitting documents if your family has a special circumstance that needs discussed and approved.
Student Services / Special Needs Program
The Student Services Program at Brent International School Manila is designed for students with mild needs. Students in our program should function in and benefit from the regular curriculum with minimal extra support aimed at bridging any gaps between a student’s abilities and the classroom expectations.
Applicants in need of support are considered on a case-by-case basis. The decision to accept and retain a student needing support is based on space availability in our program and our ability to meet the needs of the student–while ensuring the regular classroom environment is maintained.
Please submit documents relevant to your situation, in addition to the standard online application process:
Brent’s Resource Teacher Form should be completed by the current / recent school and emailed to the Admissions Office.
Documentation that provided the diagnoses.
Official evaluations and assessment reports (Speech, OT, Psych Ed reports, etc.)
Individual Educational Plan (IEP)
Learning Plan (LP)
Relevant medical reports
Decision Possibilities
Qualified applicants are considered for the same seats regardless of their nationality. Sometimes seats are not available for a qualified applicant and a Wait Pool is utilized. Sometimes an applicant is Not Accepted. Read more about decision possibilities below.
ACCEPTED
A qualified applicant is approved for admission, with a seat to enroll. The family (or company) pays the Slot Reservation Fee within five business days of receiving the acceptance letter.
WAIT POOL
A qualified applicant is approved for admission, but space is not available to enroll. The family (or company) pays the refundable Wait Pool Fee to be considered if a seat opens.
There is no guarantee that a space will open. Names remain on the Wait Pool (only for the academic year accepted for) until either a space opens or the family withdraws the application. Admissions will notify the family if a space opens.
Space availability can fluctuate even within a short time. A family might inquire and be told space is available, but by the time documents are submitted or on the day of the admissions appointments, learn that it is full. Since Admissions does not control how many apply or withdraw, or the number of sections offered, we appreciate your patience with our office. Oh, how we wish we had a crystal ball! Waiting for a space can be unsettling, and we encourage families to share their questions and concerns so that we can inform the Principal and Headmaster’s Office about a specific family when needed.
NOT ACCEPTED
An applicant is not approved for admission. The Admissions Committee does not predict success for the applicant academically and / or socially.
